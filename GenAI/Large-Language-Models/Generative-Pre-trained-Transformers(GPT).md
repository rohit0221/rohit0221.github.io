### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

#### Concept:
- **Architecture**: GPT models use the transformer architecture but only utilize the decoder part of the transformer.
- **Unidirectional Context**: GPT reads text unidirectionally, typically from left to right, meaning it generates the next word based on the previous words without considering future words.

#### Training Objective:
- **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**: GPT is trained using a causal language modeling objective, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. This autoregressive approach allows the model to generate coherent text sequences but limits its ability to understand context bidirectionally.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Like BERT, GPT is also pre-trained on a large corpus in a self-supervised manner, but its objective focuses on generating text rather than understanding the entire context.

#### Applications:
- **Text Generation**: GPT excels at generating text, making it suitable for applications like chatbots, story generation, and creative writing.
- **Fine-tuning**: Similar to BERT, GPT can also be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, because of its generative nature, it is particularly effective for tasks that involve text completion, summarization, translation, and dialogue systems.

### Key Differences

1. **Architecture**:
   - **BERT**: Uses the transformer encoder; bidirectional.
   - **GPT**: Uses the transformer decoder; unidirectional.

2. **Training Objectives**:
   - **BERT**: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).
   - **GPT**: Causal Language Modeling (CLM).

3. **Context Understanding**:
   - **BERT**: Bidirectional context understanding allows for better comprehension of sentence structure and context.
   - **GPT**: Unidirectional context understanding is better suited for text generation tasks.

4. **Applications**:
   - **BERT**: Primarily used for understanding tasks like classification, NER, and question answering.
   - **GPT**: Primarily used for generative tasks like text completion, dialogue generation, and content creation.

5. **Fine-tuning**:
   - **BERT**: Fine-tuning typically involves adding a task-specific layer on top of the pre-trained model.
   - **GPT**: Fine-tuning focuses on adapting the generative capabilities of the model to specific tasks.

In summary, BERT and GPT represent two different approaches to leveraging transformer models in NLP. BERT focuses on understanding and leveraging bidirectional context, making it powerful for comprehension tasks, while GPT focuses on unidirectional text generation, excelling in tasks that require producing coherent and contextually relevant text.

## 16. **What are the key components of the Transformer architecture?**


The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing by using self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel. Here are the key components of the Transformer architecture:

### 1. **Input Embedding**
- Converts input tokens into dense vectors of fixed dimensions. These embeddings represent the semantic information of the tokens.

### 2. **Positional Encoding**
- Since the transformer architecture doesn’t inherently handle the order of sequences, positional encoding is added to input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence. This helps the model distinguish between different positions.

### 3. **Self-Attention Mechanism**
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Computes attention scores using the dot product of the query (Q) and key (K) matrices, scaled by the square root of the dimension of the key. These scores determine how much focus each token should have on every other token in the sequence.
- **Key (K), Query (Q), Value (V)**: Derived from the input embeddings through learned linear transformations. The self-attention mechanism uses these to compute weighted representations of the input.

### 4. **Multi-Head Attention**
- Instead of performing a single attention function, multi-head attention runs multiple self-attention operations in parallel (each with different sets of learned weights). The results are concatenated and linearly transformed, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously and capture various aspects of relationships between tokens.

### 5. **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**
- Each position's output from the attention mechanism is passed through a feed-forward network, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. This helps in adding non-linearity and transforming the attention outputs into a more complex representation.

### 6. **Add & Norm**
- **Residual Connections**: Each sub-layer (e.g., self-attention, FFN) in the transformer has a residual connection around it, meaning the input to the sub-layer is added to its output. This helps in addressing the vanishing gradient problem and improves training.
- **Layer Normalization**: After adding the residual connections, layer normalization is applied to stabilize and accelerate the training process.

### 7. **Encoder and Decoder Stacks**
- **Encoder Stack**: Comprises multiple identical layers (e.g., 6 layers). Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network.
- **Decoder Stack**: Also consists of multiple identical layers. Each layer has three sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, an encoder-decoder attention mechanism (to attend to the encoder's output), and a feed-forward neural network.

### 8. **Encoder-Decoder Attention**
- In the decoder, this mechanism helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence by attending to the encoder's output while generating the output sequence.

### 9. **Output Embedding and Linear Transformation**
- The decoder’s output is transformed back into token probabilities by a linear transformation followed by a softmax layer. This produces the final output sequence.

## 17. **How do encoder-decoder models differ from pure encoder or pure decoder transformer models?**

Encoder-decoder models, pure encoder models, and pure decoder models are variations of the Transformer architecture designed for different types of tasks. Here’s how they differ:

### 1. **Encoder-Decoder Models**

#### Structure:
- **Encoder**: Consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a set of encoded representations.
- **Decoder**: Also consists of multiple layers but includes both self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. The decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoded representations from the encoder and the previously generated tokens.

#### Usage:
- **Applications**: Typically used for sequence-to-sequence tasks where the input and output are different sequences. Examples include machine translation, summarization, and question answering.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Encoder**: Converts the input sequence into a context-rich representation.
  - **Decoder**: Uses this representation to generate the output sequence step-by-step, attending to the encoded input at each step.

### 2. **Pure Encoder Models**

#### Structure:
- **Only Encoder**: Consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks without a decoding part. The focus is solely on encoding the input sequence into a rich, contextual representation.

#### Usage:
- **Applications**: Typically used for tasks that involve understanding or classification of the input sequence. Examples include text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and sentence embedding.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Self-Attention**: Helps in capturing dependencies between all tokens in the input sequence.
  - **Output**: The final representation can be fed into a classifier or another type of model for the specific task at hand.

### 3. **Pure Decoder Models**

#### Structure:
- **Only Decoder**: Consists of multiple layers of self-attention and possibly cross-attention mechanisms. Designed to generate sequences based on a given context or initial input tokens.
- **Autoregressive**: Generates one token at a time, with each token generation conditioned on the previously generated tokens.

#### Usage:
- **Applications**: Typically used for generative tasks where the model needs to produce an output sequence. Examples include text generation, language modeling, and dialogue systems.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Self-Attention**: Attends to previously generated tokens.
  - **Cross-Attention (if any context is given)**: Attends to an external context if available (e.g., prompt or input sequence for conditional generation).
  - **Output**: The model generates the next token in the sequence iteratively until the entire output sequence is produced.
