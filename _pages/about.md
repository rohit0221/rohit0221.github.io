Hi, I am Rohit!👋

A seasoned Technical R&D Manager with 15 years of experience, I specialize in designing, implementing, and delivering large-scale, cloud-native solutions that stand out for their robustness, efficiency, and performance. Currently working as an R&D manager in a highly competent team at Amdocs, I oversee the development, enhancement, verification, deployment of a Cloud Native solution for Mobile Network Optimization. My passion lies in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to innovate in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLM), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to drive forward the boundaries of technology and create cutting-edge solutions.
